The code in this folder explores the use of classification as a step towards the generation of a data set ranking. 
When it's mature enough, the goal is to merge it with the main code, replacing its regression-based parts. 

The tasks we tackle are:

1 - How should we separate the classes?

2 - Which features do we actually need?

3 - How should we use the classification results for ranking?
