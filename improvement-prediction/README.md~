# Prediction of Performance Improvement

## Requirements

* Python 3
* NumPy
* pandas
* scikit-learn

## Predicting Improvement

To predict performance improvement, first, configure the file [`params.json`](params.json):

```
{
    "learning_data_file": file that stores information about the learning task, with each line in the format <query dataset path, target attribute name, candidate dataset path, `R^2` score before augmentation, `R^2` score after augmentation>
		"n_splits": number of folds for cross-validation when evaluating the learning task
		"output_filename": output filename where all predictions, along with original lines in learning_data_file, are saved
}
```

Then, run the following:

    $ python predict-performance-improvement.py

The script will predict the likelihood of improving the performance of a machine learning model by augmenting the initial query dataset with a candidate dataset. 



generate all the query and candidate datasets under `output_directory`, and the file `training_data_file` will contain lines of the following format:

    <query dataset, candidate dataset, score before augmentation, score after augmentation>

The performance score is computed using the `R^2` regression function score.
