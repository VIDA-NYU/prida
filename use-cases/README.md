# Use Cases

## NYC Taxi and Vehicle Collisions Problem

The regression problem uses the number of taxi trips in NYC to predict the number of vehicle collisions in the city. For the augmentation, the weather data significantly improves the model.

## NYC Taxi Demand Problem

The regression problem uses temporal features to predict the number of taxi trips in NYC. For the augmentation, the weather data improves the model performance.

## Poverty Estimation Problem

The task is to estimate the number of people living in poverty in 2016 across counties in the US using population estimates. For the augmentation, unemployment rates are used to help improve the model performance.

## College Debt Problem

The problem is to predict the median debt-to-earnings ratio of colleges across the US. The supplied dataset consists of a minimal version of the College Scorecards dataset, which make it easier for students to search for a college that is a good fit for them. For the augmentation, additional scorecard information helps improve the model performance.
